    <h1>Trey Marak</h1>

    <p>Howdy! My name is Trey Marak and I was born and raised in Dallas, TX. I lived in the suburbs of Dallas in a town called Rockwall. I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2005 and started working in the televison industry. I then move into radio where I was a morning show producer for i93. The most fun I had is when we broadcasted live from behind the stage at the 2011 Grammys.</p>

    <p>I decided to move on from the radio industry and obtained my MBA. I love to play golf, cook, and watch sports. I love all Dallas sports teams as well as Texas A&M Aggies! In my spare time, I'm a closet comic book nerd. I love to read and study comic book characters and events. Gig'em!</p>
